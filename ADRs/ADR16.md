# ADR16: PIPO Implementation Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement an PIPO system for our WorkHourLogger integration. This component will need to handle webhook events from multiple sources, correlate related events, and maintain state during the processing workflow.

## Decision Drivers
* Response time requirements
* Operational complexity and maintenance overhead
* Scalability needs
* Development expertise available
* Integration complexity with AI agents
* Long-term flexibility and customization requirements

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Serverless Functions with Event Store
**Description**: Implement using AWS Lambda/Azure Functions for webhook handling with DynamoDB/Cosmos DB for state management.

**Pros**:
* Low operational overhead
* Built-in scaling capabilities
* Reduced infrastructure management

**Cons**:
* Cold starts impact response time
* More complex state management across function invocations
* Higher latency for event correlation

### Option 2: Containerized Microservice with Message Queue
**Description**: Deploy a Kubernetes-based API service with Kafka/RabbitMQ for event processing.

**Pros**:
* More control over infrastructure and deployment
* Lower overall latency
* Better suited for complex event correlations

**Cons**:
* Higher operational complexity
* Requires more DevOps expertise
* More resource overhead

### Option 3: Managed Integration Service
**Description**: Utilize services like AWS AppFlow or Azure Logic Apps.

**Pros**:
* Minimal custom code required
* Managed service reliability
* Faster initial deployment

**Cons**:
* Less flexibility for custom business logic
* Potential vendor lock-in
* Limited customization options for AI agent integration

## Decision
We will implement the **Containerized Microservice with Message Queue** approach for our Event Aggregator implementation.

## Rationale
After evaluating all options, the Containerized Microservice approach provides the best balance of control, performance, and flexibility for our specific requirements:

1. The performance consistency outweighs the additional operational complexity
2. We have the necessary DevOps expertise on the team
3. The complex event correlation requirements benefit from the lower latency of a dedicated service
4. Future AI agent integration will require customization capabilities that managed services may limit

## Consequences

### Positive
* Better overall performance for event processing
* More flexibility to implement custom business logic
* Greater control over scaling and infrastructure decisions
* Better positioned for future enhancements

### Negative
* Higher initial implementation effort
* Increased operational responsibilities
* More infrastructure to maintain and monitor

## Implementation Notes
1. Initially deploy in our existing Kubernetes cluster
2. Use Kafka as the message queue for its partitioning and retention capabilities
3. Implement proper monitoring and alerting from day one
4. Document the deployment and operational procedures clearly for the DevOps team

## Related Decisions
* Will need to decide on specific Kubernetes deployment strategy
* Message queue configuration and topic design to be determined
* Monitoring and observability tooling selection
