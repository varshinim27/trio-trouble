### ADR 8: Incremental Feature Deployment Strategy

**Context**:
The solution involves multiple features with varying complexity and interdependencies.

**Decision**:
Implement features incrementally in three phases, with early phases focused on foundation and high-impact improvements.

**Rationale**:
- Delivers value earlier in the implementation timeline
- Reduces risk by validating core capabilities before building advanced features
- Allows for user feedback to influence later development
- Aligns resource allocation with priority features

**Consequences**:
- Requires careful feature sequencing to manage dependencies
- May create temporary inconsistencies in user experience during rollout
- Needs clear communication about feature availability timeline
- Creates additional complexity in managing partially implemented capabilities
