### ADR 6: Microservices Architecture for System Extensions

**Context**:
Different components of our solution have varying development cycles, scaling needs, and technology requirements.

**Decision**:
Implement system extensions using a microservices architecture with clear boundaries and communication contracts.

**Rationale**:
- Allows independent development and deployment of components
- Enables appropriate technology selection for each service
- Supports incremental implementation of the feature roadmap
- Provides better fault isolation and scalability

**Consequences**:
- Introduces distributed system complexity
- Requires strong API governance and versioning
- Needs robust service discovery and communication patterns
- Will require additional operational infrastructure for monitoring and management
