### ADR 2: AI-Enhanced Matching and Template Selection

**Context**:
Current manual template selection and interviewer matching processes are time-consuming and error-prone, leading to inappropriate panel selection and high cancellation rates.

**Decision**:
Implement AI capabilities for automated template selection and intelligent interviewer matching while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.

**Rationale**:
- Addresses root causes of interview cancellations and scheduling delays
- Automates complex decision-making that currently requires manual effort
- Improves matching quality between candidates, requirements, and interviewer skills
- Can adapt and improve over time with more historical data

**Consequences**:
- Requires initial training data and ongoing monitoring of AI recommendations
- Needs clear explainability for AI decisions to build user trust
- Must include override mechanisms for edge cases
- Will require careful integration with MindComputeScheduler's existing matching algorithms
