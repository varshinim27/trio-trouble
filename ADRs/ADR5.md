### ADR 5: Messenger AI Assistant Interface

**Context**:
Recruiters need an efficient way to find appropriate interviewers and manage scheduling processes without switching between multiple tools.

**Decision**:
Develop an AI assistant in Messenger that provides natural language interface to scheduling functions rather than building a separate application.

**Rationale**:
- Meets users in their existing workflow environment
- Leverages familiar Messenger interface for intuitive interaction
- Reduces learning curve and adoption barriers
- Simplifies deployment and updates compared to standalone applications

**Consequences**:
- Limited by Messenger API capabilities and UI constraints
- Requires robust natural language processing for effective interaction
- Needs careful design for complex operations and error handling
- Must handle authentication and authorization appropriately
