### ADR 7: Multi-Source Data Integration for Analytics

**Context**:
Comprehensive analytics and insights require data from multiple systems including MindComputeScheduler, InterviewLogger, MyMindComputeProfile, and internal tracking systems.

**Decision**:
Implement a data integration layer that combines information from multiple sources for unified analytics and reporting.

**Rationale**:
- Enables end-to-end visibility of the interview process
- Supports advanced analytics and pattern recognition
- Allows for custom metrics and KPIs not available in individual systems
- Creates foundation for predictive capabilities in later phases

**Consequences**:
- Requires data synchronization and consistency strategies
- Needs careful handling of data privacy and access controls
- Creates additional storage and processing requirements
- Must address potential data quality issues across sources
