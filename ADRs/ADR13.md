# ADR 13: Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our architecture requires a container orchestration platform that can:
- Deploy and manage microservices across multiple environments
- Scale services based on demand
- Provide service discovery and load balancing
- Support automated deployment pipelines
- Offer robust monitoring and observability

We need to select a container orchestration platform that balances operational needs with team expertise and industry alignment.

## Decision
We will use Kubernetes as our container orchestration platform.

## Rationale
- **Industry standard**: Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration
- **Team familiarity**: MindCompute has significant expertise with Kubernetes
- **Rich ecosystem**: Extensive tooling for monitoring, deployment, and security
- **Platform agnostic**: Supports deployment across cloud providers and on-premises
- **Declarative configuration**: Infrastructure-as-Code friendly with YAML-based configuration
- **Scalability**: Proven scalability for services similar to our needs
- **Automated healing**: Self-healing capabilities reduce operational burden

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Docker Swarm**:
   - Benefits: Simplicity, lower operational overhead
   - Drawbacks: Limited feature set, smaller community, less robust ecosystem

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Robust orchestration capabilities, extensive ecosystem support, alignment with industry standards
- **Negative**: Operational complexity, learning curve for new team members, requires dedicated DevOps expertise
- **Mitigations**: Use managed Kubernetes services, implement GitOps for infrastructure management, provide team training
