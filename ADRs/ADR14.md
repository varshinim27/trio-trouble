# ADR 14: MongoDB as Event Storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our event-driven architecture requires a database solution that can:
- Store event data with varying schemas and structures
- Scale horizontally to handle growth in event volume
- Provide good performance for event storage and retrieval
- Support flexible querying patterns for event correlation
- Handle schema evolution as our domain model evolves

## Decision
We will use MongoDB as our primary event storage system.

## Rationale
- **Schema flexibility**: Document model easily accommodates varying event structures
- **Query capabilities**: Rich query language with good support for complex queries
- **Performance**: Good write performance for event ingestion
- **Horizontal scaling**: Mature sharding capabilities for horizontal scaling
- **Ecosystem maturity**: Stable drivers, monitoring tools, and hosting options
- **Developer familiarity**: Widely used within MindCompute
- **Change streams**: Native support for change data capture enables event-driven patterns

## Alternatives Considered
1. **PostgreSQL with JSONB**:
   - Benefits: SQL querying, ACID compliance, combining relational and document data
   - Drawbacks: More complex horizontal scaling, less natural fit for document-centric data

2. **Cassandra**:
   - Benefits: Linear scalability, high write throughput, multi-region capabilities
   - Drawbacks: Limited querying, eventual consistency challenges, higher operational complexity

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Flexible data model, good performance for expected workloads, easier accommodation of changing requirements
- **Negative**: Eventual consistency model requires careful design, joins are less efficient than relational databases
- **Mitigations**: Implement appropriate data modeling patterns, use denormalization where necessary, ensure proper indexing
