### ADR 1: Extend MindComputeScheduler as the Central Platform

**Context**:
MindCompute currently uses MindComputeScheduler as the central scheduling platform with existing integrations to InterviewLogger, MyMindComputeProfile, and Calendar. We need to decide whether to build a new system, create middleware, or enhance the existing platform.

**Decision**:
We will extend MindComputeScheduler's capabilities through its API and custom integrations rather than building a new system or middleware layer.

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing investment and established user familiarity
- Maintains current integrations with critical systems (InterviewLogger, MyMindComputeProfile, Calendar)
- Reduces implementation time, cost, and change management burden
- Allows for incremental improvements without disrupting current processes

**Consequences**:
- Solutions will be constrained by MindComputeScheduler's API capabilities and extension points
- May require negotiation with MindComputeScheduler for custom features or API enhancements
- Creates dependency on MindComputeScheduler's platform evolution and roadmap
- Will require careful design to ensure extensions don't conflict with core functionality
