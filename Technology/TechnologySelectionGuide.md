## Technology Selection Principles

Our technology choices adhere to the following principles:

1. **Prefer open-source technologies** with strong community support over proprietary alternatives when performance and capabilities are comparable
2. **Leverage existing expertise** within MindCompute to minimize training needs and accelerate delivery
3. **Prioritize operational simplicity** over cutting-edge features to ensure reliable operation and maintainability
4. **Select technologies with proven production usage** at similar scale and complexity
5. **Consider total cost of ownership** including licensing, infrastructure, and operational complexity
6. **Maintain flexibility** for future evolution by avoiding tight coupling to vendor-specific services

These principles ensure that our technology choices balance immediate delivery needs with long-term maintainability and evolution of the system.
