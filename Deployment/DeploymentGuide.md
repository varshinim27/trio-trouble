# Deployment Architecture Guide

Our deployment architecture balances operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability for MindCompute' interview processes.

## Infrastructure Overview

- **Primary Region**: India (Mumbai)
   - Proximity to most interviewers
   - Data residency compliance
   - Alignment with operations

## Key Components

| Component | Implementation | Configuration |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Container Orchestration** | Kubernetes | Multi-zone single cluster |
| **Service Mesh** | Istio | Traffic management, security |
| **Database** | MongoDB | Replica set with backups |
| **Message Broker** | Kafka | Multi-broker cluster |
| **Cache** | Redis | Distributed with persistence |

## Environment Strategy

- **Development**: Feature development with synthetic data
- **QA**: Integration testing with anonymized data subset
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation with full anonymized data
- **Production**: Full capacity with redundancy

## Deployment Pipeline

1. **Build**: Compile, containerize, unit test, security scan
2. **Test**: Integration and contract testing
3. **Validation**: End-to-end and performance testing
4. **Pre-Production**: Final validation with approval gate
5. **Production**: Canary deployment with automated verification

## Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal**: Auto-scaling based on CPU, memory, custom metrics
- **Vertical**: Appropriate sizing for workload types
- **Time-Based**: Scheduled scaling for predictable load patterns

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

- **Multi-zone** deployment within primary region
- **Replicated** stateful services with automated failover
- **Regular backups** with point-in-time recovery
- **RTO**: 4 hours | **RPO**: 15 minutes | **Availability**: 99.5%

## Security Controls

- **Network**: Private cluster, service mesh encryption, WAF
- **Access**: RBAC, IAM integration, just-in-time admin access
- **Data**: TLS for communications, encryption at rest, masking

## Monitoring

- **Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger
- **Dashboards**: System health, business KPIs, capacity trends
- **Alerts**: Severity-based routing with escalation policies

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure components are defined and versioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles:

- **Kubernetes Resources**: Helm charts and Kustomize overlays
- **Cloud Resources**: Terraform modules for provisioning
- **Configuration**: GitOps approach with ArgoCD
- **Secrets**: External secrets operator with Vault integration

## CI/CD Implementation

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitLab CI with the following key features:

- **Pipeline as Code**: All pipelines defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **Environment Promotion**: Automated promotion with manual approval gates
- **Artifact Management**: Container images and deployment manifests in GitLab Registry
- **Deployment Strategy**: Canary deployments with automated verification

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Kubernetes: 3-node cluster (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)
- MongoDB: 1 primary, 2 replicas (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)
- Message Broker: 3-node Kafka cluster (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes: 5-node cluster (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM each)
- MongoDB: 1 primary, 2 replicas (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)
- Message Broker: 5-node Kafka cluster (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)

## Network Architecture

- **DMZ**: API Gateway, WAF, Load Balancers
- **Application Zone**: Kubernetes Pods, Service Mesh Components
- **Data Zone**: MongoDB, Kafka, Redis
- **Management Zone**: Monitoring, Logging, CI/CD Tools

## Deployment Checklist

Before each production deployment, verify:

1. All integration tests pass in staging environment
2. Security scanning shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
3. Resource requirements are met in target environment
4. Backup and rollback procedures are tested
5. On-call schedule is confirmed for post-deployment support

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Fast Rollback**: Revert to previous container images (automated)
2. **Database Rollback**: Restore from point-in-time backup if needed
3. **Infrastructure Rollback**: Revert to previous Terraform state
4. **Communication Plan**: Notify stakeholders of rollback and impact
