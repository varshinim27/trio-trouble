## Introduction
MindCompute faces significant challenges efficiently scheduling technical interviews, with manual processes creating bottlenecks in the hiring pipeline. Our solution automates and enhances the interview scheduling process through:

1. AI-powered matching between candidates and interviewers
2. Intelligent automation of manual scheduling tasks
3. Seamless integration with existing systems (InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, calendars)
4. Enhanced visibility and analytics for all stakeholders

This architecture addresses critical pain points identified through stakeholder interviews while leveraging existing tools and infrastructure.

## Existing System Context and Enhancement Approach

### Current System Capabilities

MindCompute recently migrated to MindComputeScheduler as its interview scheduling platform. MindComputeScheduler is already a robust solution with significant capabilities:

- **Rich Integration Ecosystem**:
   - Calendar API for real-time availability management
   - MailHandler integration for automated communications
   - LeavePlanner integration for interviewer availability
   - InterviewLogger ATS integration for candidate data

- **Existing Automation Features**:
   - Intelligent interviewer matching based on tags
   - Curated persona templates for interviewer and interviewee
   - Automated scheduling based on availability
   - Built-in tag management system for skill identification
   - Interview analytics dashboards

   - Automated interview rescheduling capibilities given an interview declined

- **Industry Adoption**: MindComputeScheduler is widely adopted in the industry as a leading interview scheduling solution

### Enhancement vs. Replacement Rationale

Our stakeholder interviews revealed that while MindComputeScheduler provides a solid foundation, there are specific pain points and inefficiencies in the current workflow. Our architectural approach deliberately avoids a disruptive "rip and replace" strategy for several compelling reasons:

1. **Recent Migration Investment**: MindCompute has recently invested significant resources in migrating from  TalentFitAssessorto MindComputeScheduler. Abandoning this investment would be cost-prohibitive and disruptive.

2. **Adoption Curve Considerations**: Users are still adapting to MindComputeScheduler, and introducing an entirely new system would create unnecessary change management challenges.

3. **Targeted Efficiency Gaps**: Our user research identified specific bottlenecks that can be addressed through targeted enhancements rather than wholesale replacement:
   - Manual interview template selection and configuration
   - Outdated interviewer tags and skills information
   - Limited intelligence in matching algorithms
   - Administrative overhead for interviewers
   - Limited interviewer pool

4. **Ecosystem Leverage**: By building on MindComputeScheduler's existing integrations with InterviewLogger, Calendar, and other systems, we can deliver value faster while minimizing integration complexity.

5. **Complementary Technology Landscape**: Other tools like BrightHire are already effectively handling interview recording and summarization. Our solution complements these existing tools rather than competing with them.

### Enhancement Strategy

Based on this context, our architecture focuses on:

1. **Extending MindComputeScheduler's Core Capabilities**: Adding intelligence and automation where the platform currently lacks it
2. **Bridging Integration Gaps**: Connecting systems that don't currently talk to each other
3. **Adding AI Intelligence**: Introducing AI agents to optimize matching, classification, and decision-making
4. **Process Automation**: Eliminating manual steps while preserving the overall workflow

This approach allows us to deliver immediate value by addressing the most critical pain points while respecting the organization's recent investment in MindComputeScheduler and minimizing disruption to users.

## User Research Findings

We conducted structured interviews with key stakeholders to thoroughly understand the current interview scheduling process and identify critical pain points:

### Process Overview
The current interview scheduling at MindCompute involves four primary stakeholders across multiple systems:
- **Recruiters** initiate the process through InterviewLogger and define requirements
- **Talent Operations** coordinate scheduling through MindComputeScheduler templates and panel selection
- **Interviewers** conduct technical assessments and provide feedback
- **Candidates** select available time slots and participate in interviews

### Primary Pain Points

1. **Extended Scheduling Timeline**
   - Talent Operations requires 2-3 days to schedule interviews after receiving requests
   - Manual coordination creates bottlenecks, particularly when rescheduling is needed
   - Limited visibility into scheduling progress for recruiters and candidates
   - Communication gaps between recruiter and talent ops

2. **Interviewer Matching Challenges**
   - Skill tags in MindComputeScheduler often outdated or misaligned with actual expertise
   - Limited mechanisms to verify interviewer qualifications
   - Manual template selection process prone to errors
   - MindComputeScheduler automation sometimes selects inappropriate interviewers

3. **Availability & Scheduling Conflicts**
   - Limited panel availability
   - High decline rate 
   - Rescheduling process requires significant manual coordination

4. **Administrative Burden**
   - Interviewers spend considerable time on  CandidateEvaluationSheet completion
   - Talent Operations team stretched thin across multiple recruiters
   - Limited recognition or incentives for active interviewers
   - No defined process to identify new interviewers

5. **System Integration Gaps**
   - Limited scheduling strategies between in identifying calendar slots
   - Manual feedback transfer between systems
   - Lack of unified analytics across the interview process
   - Interviewers often misses WorkHourLogger entries

These findings directly informed our requirements and feature prioritization, ensuring our solution addresses the most impactful pain points for all stakeholders.

## Requirements

To achieve effective requirement identification, we employed a collaborative approach involving job candidate, recruiter, talent ops associate,
interviewer, to bring a different viewpoint to the table, helping us explore all dimensions of the hiring process from user
experience to technical feasibility. Through workshops, we gathered insights and identified pain points in the current
hiring processes.

The requirements are detailed in the following
sections: 
 - [Functional Requirements](Requirements/FunctionalRequirements.md)  
 - [Non-Functional Requirements](Requirements/NonFunctionalRequirements.md)


## Business Metrics and Success Criteria

To ensure our solution delivers measurable business value, we've established specific success criteria across four key dimensions: efficiency, engagement, quality, and cost. These metrics will guide our design decisions and help stakeholders evaluate the impact of the implemented system.

### Efficiency Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current State | Measurement Approach |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Interview scheduling time | 50% reduction | Currently 2-3 days | Time from request to confirmation |
| Interview decline rate | 40% reduction | Currently approximately 4 out of 10 | Percentage of declined interviews |

### Engagement Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current State | Measurement Approach |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Interviewer participation | 25% increase | X active interviewers | Number of active interviewers monthly |
| Interviewer recognition | 70% satisfaction | Limited recognition | Surveyed satisfaction with recognition |

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current State | Measurement Approach |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Interviewer-skill match accuracy | 90% match rate | Not currently measured | Post-interview feedback analysis |
| Template selection accuracy | 95% correct selection | Requires manual verification | Reduction in template changes |

### Cost Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current State | Measurement Approach |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Talent Operations time savings | 40% reduction | Full-time coordination | Hours spent on scheduling tasks |
| Interview rescheduling rate | 30% reduction | High reschedule frequency | Percentage of rescheduled interviews |

These metrics align directly with our proposed features and will be tracked throughout implementation to ensure we're delivering value in each phase of the project. Each metric has been selected based on stakeholder input and identified pain points in the current process.

## Features and Roadmap

### Prioritization Framework

To ensure we're delivering the most impactful features first, we employed the RICE prioritization framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to evaluate and rank potential features. This data-driven approach helped us balance immediate pain points with long-term strategic improvements.

Our analysis revealed several critical bottlenecks in the current process:

1. **Extended Scheduling Timeline**: Talent Operations currently requires 2-3 days to schedule interviews after receiving requests from recruiters, significantly extending the hiring timeline.

2. **Limited Interviewer Pool**: The available pool of interviewers for specific skills and interview types is often constrained, leading to scheduling conflicts and delays.

3. **Manual Tag Management**: The process of assigning and updating interviewer tags (skills, preferences, etc.) is largely manual, leading to outdated information and suboptimal matching.

4. **Time-consuming Administrative Tasks**: Interviewers spend valuable time on administrative tasks like WorkHourLogger entries and  CandidateEvaluationSheet completion rather than conducting interviews.

5. **High Interview Cancellation Rate**: Interviews are frequently cancelled by interviewers, primarily due to incorrect information leading to inappropriate panel selection. This creates rescheduling work and extends hiring timelines.

### Feature Roadmap

3. **End-to-End Testing** confirms business processes work correctly from the user perspective

We've established three testing environments (Development, QA, and Staging) with increasing fidelity to production, and implemented specialized approaches for third-party API testing and test data management.

For the complete integration testing strategy, including environment details, MindComputeScheduler-specific testing, and success metrics, please refer to the [Integration Testing Strategy](./Testing/TestingStrategy.md) document.

## Deployment Architecture

Our system is deployed on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure in a primary region in India (Mumbai), chosen for proximity to most interviewers, data residency compliance, and alignment with existing operations.

### Key Infrastructure Elements

- **Containerized Deployment**: All components deployed as containers on Kubernetes ([ADR 13](./ADRs/ADR13.md))
- **Multi-Zone Configuration**: Distributed across availability zones for resilience
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for secure service-to-service communication
- **Stateful Services**: MongoDB ([ADR 14](./ADRs/ADR14.md)) for data persistence, RabbitMQ ([ADR 12](./ADRs/ADR12.md)) for messaging
- **Environment Strategy**: Separate development, QA, staging, and production environments

### Deployment Pipeline

We implement a GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline with progressive delivery through multiple environments, automated testing at each stage, and canary deployments for production updates. Our approach ensures zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback capabilities.

### Scaling & Availability

The system is designed for 99.5% availability with horizontal auto-scaling based on demand metrics, appropriate resource allocation for different workload types, and comprehensive disaster recovery measures (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 15 minutes).

For comprehensive details on infrastructure, deployment processes, and operational procedures, please refer to the [Deployment Architecture Guide](./Deployment/DeploymentGuide.md).

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategy

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **API Integration Failures** | Service disruption, scheduling delays | • Contract testing with MindComputeScheduler/InterviewLogger<br>• Versioned API interfaces<br>• Circuit breaker patterns | Automated fallback to manual process with alerts |
| **Data Quality Issues** | Poor matching results, eroded trust | • Data validation pipelines<br>• Quality monitoring<br>• Confidence scoring | Human review workflow for low-confidence matches |
| **User Adoption Resistance** | Underutilized system, limited ROI | • Early stakeholder involvement<br>• Phased rollout with champions<br>• Minimal workflow disruption | Extended parallel operations with targeted incentives |
| **AI Model Performance** | Suboptimal interviewer matches | • Human-in-the-loop for complex decisions<br>• Regular retraining cycles<br>• A/B testing framework | Rules-based fallback system with gradual ML transition |
| **MindComputeScheduler Platform Changes** | Breaking extensions, delayed features | • Defensive integration design<br>• Vendor relationship management<br>• Change notification monitoring | Abstraction layer to isolate from vendor changes |

### Risk Monitoring Approach

* Real-time risk monitoring dashboards with automated alerts for threshold violations
* Automated integration health checks with instant notifications for API failures
* Weekly risk review meetings with technical and business stakeholders
* Comprehensive testing focused on integration points and data flows
* Continuous monitoring of data quality metrics with alerting for anomaly detection

### Technical Safeguards

* **Event System**: Dead-letter queues, idempotent processing
* **Distributed Systems**: Eventual consistency patterns and compensating transactions
* **Performance**: Load testing with 3x expected volume and auto-scaling infrastructure
* **Security**: Regular penetration testing and compliance reviews

### Organizational Readiness

* Skills development program for support team in AI/ML operations
* Clear escalation paths for technical and process issues
